#Project: AutoMotive Data Measurement and Visualization

This project is designed to measure sensor data from a device and generate real-time X-Y axis charts. Leveraging WebSocket.io technology, the application provides a robust and highly optimized solution for visualizing data. Even under challenging network conditions, our APIs consistently deliver data within an impressive 40-millisecond timeframe.

Our commitment to stability, optimization, and real-time data visualization sets this project apart.
